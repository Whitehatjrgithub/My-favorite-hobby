    <h1>My Hobby Is Reading Books!</h1>
    <section id="welcome">
    </section>

    <p>My hobby is reading fictional and mystery books a lot. I read after homework, at school, before bed, and whenever I have free time! I am 10 years old and I am in 5th grade. I love going to the libary and getting new books and re-reading some.As well as fiction and mystery I also love to read non-fiction from time to time. I like Harry Potter, Sprinkle Sundays and Weird-but-true book seires. Reading is very fun and entertaining.</p>
